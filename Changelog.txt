<--------------------------------------- 1.4 -------------------------------------------->
*Added separated mod package(Parabellum - Earned in Blood & Parabellum - Hold the Line) for who only want handheld weapons or defensive turrets and explosives
1.4 - deleted Icon texture cuz is pointless to have it, since the ammo icons are replaced by projectile icons to keep the file size small 

Tweaks:
-Nerfed S-Mine explosive radius(2.2 -> 1.6), making it more anti-personnel focus than explosive one, the trade off is reduce the gunpowder need to build it from 4 -> 2

<--------------------------------------- 1.3 -------------------------------------------->
1.3 - 2 weapons, 8 Turret, 6 new ammo type, and lots of tweaks

SMGs:

Launchers:
-Panzerschreck / Raketenpanzerbüchse 54/1: Single Shot, Early-Mid game Rocket Launcher, relatively cheap but quite heavy and bulky

Ammo:
-50mm Pzgr 39(APHE): High Explosive Armor Piercing shell, more metal slug than explosive, produce small quantity of fragment when impact the target
-50mm Pzgr 40(APCR): Armor Piercing, Compound Rigid shell, high velocity solid metal slug, minimal explosive effect when impact
-50mm Sprgr 38(HE): High Explosive shell, standard Explosive shell, is small and rather weak but it get the job done
-88mm RPzB Gr. 4992 HEAT Rocket: High Explosive Anti-Tank, standard RPzB rocket, not strong as modern rockets but good enought counter armored target, only effective with direct hit
-88mm RPzB Gr. 4992 Frag Rocket: Fragmentation(Anti-Personnel), modified RPzB rocket, very weak explosive effect and poor penetration, but it has considerable high fragmentation effect

Tweaks:
+slightly increased 120mm Wombat drawsize
+Nebelwerfer crate now are stackable up to 6 max
+Moved 120mm WombatRATG to new Architect tab: Anti-Tank Guns(P)
+Renamed Architect tab of "Artillery(Parabellum)" to "Rocket Artillery(P)"
+Changed both Nebelwerfer 21 and Nebelwerfer 32 tech level from "Industrial" to "Spacer" scale, Wurfrahmen still remain at Industrial
+Changed XM-307 ACSW tech level from "Industrial" to "Ultra" scale, and its crate from "normalcrate" to "Rarecrate" (what a major fked up I forgot here)
+Separated most ammo in the Resource Readout list(the one on the upper left side of your ingame screen) with their own icon instead of too many ammo with the same base HSK ammo icon
+Nebelwerfer rockets now are only craftable in the Electric Machining Table
+Panzerfaust warhead now are only craftable in the Ammo Bench
+Rename most turrets with long names to make then fit better in the HUD
+Changed some barebone description, mostly turrets one
+Buff M202 FLASH TAE Rockets damage, now is bit more effective counter armored target such as centipede(you still need atleast 4 rockets to deal with one of those, pray RNG God for that)
+Simplified M202 FLASH TEA rocket ammo, now use HSK M72 LAW rocket base
+Buff Panzerfaust 60 accuracy, to compensate better the projectile speed and the range of the weapon
+Shortened few ammo description to make them fit in the selection HUD
+Fixed some typos(still working on those)

+Changed Nebelwerfer accuracy, trajectory and fragment type
+Increase Vickers long burst from 10 shots to 25 shots
-Increased M1928A1 Thompson recoil and spread a bit
-Following Weapons now require wood to craft them, reason - they have wooden parts:
 -Huot Automatic Rifle
 -De Lisle Commando Carbine
 -Lewis LMG
 -Thompson M1928A1 SMG
 -Sturter Survival Pistol
 -Medusa Survival Revolver
 
 Note: been tinkering the rocket launchers, atleast for the Multiple Rocket Launcher I have added for my mod, now their stats doesn't use base HSK reference, and they behave lot different, still need more extensive playtesting to make them fun and practical to use, atleast, server their purpose

<--------------------------------------- 1.2(Combind with 1.2A) -------------------------------------------->
1.2A - 2 Turrets, 8 new ammo types, more tweaks and research tree changes
*1.2 - 5 Grenades, 1 turret, 3 new ammo type, more tweaks, texture improvements, proper research tree and designate bench for all weapons

Turrets:
*(Nebelwerfer rely a lots of explosive material, such as gunpowders and FSX, since they are not mean to be precision artillery)
-Nebelwerfer 32cm: 28cm/30cm/32cm Nebelwerfer Rockets, 6 barrel/rail rocket launcher(manned - selective fire), Short Range and low projectile velocity for artillery with massive damage
-Wurfrahmen: 28cm/30cm/32cm Nebelwerfer Rockets, Single Rail rocket Launcher(Manned - Single Shot), Short Range and low projectile velocity for artillery with massive damage
-Nebelwerfer 21cm: 21cm/15cm Nebelwerfer Rockets, 5 barrel/rail rocket launcher(manned - selective fire), Medium Range rocket artillery, capable of directfire(with certain ammo type)
*-120mm Wombat Recoiless Anti-Tank Gun,  Single Shot, short range stationary light Anti-Tank Weapon

*Mines/Traps:
*-S-mine: Anti-Personnel trip mine, explosive charge with lots of fragments
*-Improvised 4kg Mine: Explosive Trip mine, large explosive radius and decent amount of Fragments

*Grenades:
-Model 24 Stielhandgranate, standard High Explosive stick grenade, no fragmentation, increased throwing range, low damage with slightly more blast radius, cheap to mass produce
-Model 24 with Splitterring, like above, but with splitter frament cover on the warhead, reduced blast radius exchanging fragmentation damage.
-Model 24 Nebelgranate, use modified warhead to produce smoke screen.
-Model 24 Bundle Charge, 6 + 1 warhead, 7 times the explosive damage, so for the cost, due the increased weight, the throwing range is reduced drastically.
-4kg Demolition Charge, a heavy piece of demolition satchel charge, as soon as you throw it, run for your life.

Ammo:
-28cm High Explosive Nebelwerfer Rocket, large explosive blast radius with lots of fragmentation and blast damage
-30cm Improved High Explosive Nebelwerfer Rocket, Improved projectile speed, massive explosive blast radius with even more fragmentation and blast damage
-32cm Incendiary Nebelwefer Rocket, massive explosive blast radius with flame damage, can cover a large zone with fire.

-21cm High Explosive Nebelwerfer Rocket, better projectile speed, due the scale down and modification it weaken the damage effects
-15cm High Explosive Nebelwerfer Rocket, even better prejectile speed, but it performance is weaker than average 155mm artillery in single shot
-15cm High Explosive Nebelwerfer Rocket(D), Direct Fire of previous rocket type, reducing the travel time and more accurate with direct targeting, can't aim at targets behind cover though
-15cm Smoke rocket, produce temporary smoke screen to either disturb enemies accuracy or to push and assault.

*-120mm Canister, equivalent of shotgun buckshot but for 120mm gun, lots of spread
*-120mm HESH, High-Explosive Squash Head, high explosive damage with penetration effect, but offers less penetration and fragmentation effect
*-120mm Low Velocity High Explosive, use for indirect fire support, with the same payload as HE shell

Tweaks:
+ Texture Improvements for CGR ammo(no longer small sprites)
+ Updated SK Research Tree adaptation(mostly for turrets, since small fire arms are tied to benches than research trees)
*+ Texture Improvement for XM-307ACSW(remake the entire weapon texture, mostly the turret base)
*+ Texture Improvement for Nebelwerfer(15cm/21cm), now have a bit shiny surface
*- Nerfed Lewis LMG to be more like between the L-15 LMG and Huot AR
*+Changed Mk.14 Mod.0 to behave more like an Late/Endgame Marksman/Battle Rifle rather than a better version of SCAR-H, now with less spawn chance and it performance should be between AR and SR...
*+Increase NbW32 blast Radius and damage, but now they are lot less accurate
