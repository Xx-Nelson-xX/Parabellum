# Parabellum
A HSK Rimworld Add-on Mod

  First thing first I would like to thank all the modder of Hardcore SK and modders who create mods for it, who showed me a brand new Rimworld experience and introduce me to the world of modding for Rimworld(Mainy HSK).

  This mod started with the idea to fill HSK CE combat system, mainly to add more weapon variety to the basic ammo type, but the more I play with the combat system, the more fun stuff I found when modding it, so I decided to keep going  with my modding capability and keep expanding the mod.

mostly Industrial scale stuff(IRL,Between WWI era and till Nowadays)

1. Guns, lots of guns
2. Turrets
3. Explosives
4. New Ammo type

*EXTRA NOTES:

**NOW THE MOD HAS SEPARATED PACKAGE

For Guns and Handheld Weapons -> Parabellum - Earned in Blood

For Defensive turrets and Explosives -> Parabellum - Hold the Line

to get them you need to switch the branch from "main" to any of them, don't use the main mod with them if you don't want duplicated item error in your log

**Â¿BASE GAME SUPPORT?

Mmmmm maybe, gonna have a hard time balance it, material conversion, obligatory use CE within the mod, probably change all the stats of all the weapons and turrets since the Base game CE has totally different balance compared to the one in HSK

I do speak and write English, Spanish and Chinese(not traditional, atleast not writing it), the thing is, I never mastered any of those language so typo is expected, and English is not my main language, I am just fortunate to learn it when I was young, and sadly I don't speak Russian, I can't interact with the russian server of HSK due that reason 

Any issue(either balance or bug) or suggestion report it to me please!

Also Sorry this is my first time using GitHub, I really need some advise of how it works

Any support can help me, if you like donation, here is my Ko-fi link: https://ko-fi.com/xxnelsonxx78863

**THANKS FOR USING THE MOD :D
